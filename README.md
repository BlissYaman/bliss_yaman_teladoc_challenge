I have created a CukesRunner java class under the runner package to run my test scenarios. I can include tags on top of my feature file to run all the scenarios in a feature file by adding the same tag on the cucumber options. Alternatively, I can add tags on top of each scenario/scenario outline and then put the same tag on cucumber options.
